Mentoring about Node.js, JavaScript and backend development by Rafa≈Ç Pocztarski

Please add new questions as new issues in this repo
instead of sending me questions in private emails or hipchat messages.
That way I will not have to answer the same questions multiple times
and other people will be able to benefit as well,
instead of only the one asking.

When I have time I will go through the issues and update the repo
with info that you ask about.

Meanwhile I'll be going through things that I've written before
to add here if it makes sense.

Some quick links for a good start:
