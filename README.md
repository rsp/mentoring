Mentoring about Node.js, JavaScript and backend development by Rafa≈Ç Pocztarski

Add new questions as new issues
instead of sending me questions in private emails or hipchat messages.
That way I will not have to answer the same questions multiple times
and other people will be able to benefit as well,
instead of only the one asking.

When I have time I will go through the issues and update the repo
with info that you ask about.
